## About

This repository contains scripts to summarize and visualize MARVEL SNAP game 
data collected using this [tracker template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tdbg3pHXNWEghWvfgc3me8wKYjGyMq_eREOW9QR4sF8/edit?usp=drive_link).
As well, I have included data from my own games that can be used as examples.

These scripts are unnecessary to obtain a summary/visualization of your data, 
but they do provide a good foundation to build on for deeper analyses or more 
intricate visualizations. However, if you are uncomfortable using R for 
whatever reason, similar results can still be obtained through Excel/Sheets. 
For most people, the base chart and deck stats included in the Sheets template 
will be sufficient enough.
