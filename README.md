## About

This repository contains scripts to summarize and visualize MARVEL SNAP game 
data collected using this [tracker template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tdbg3pHXNWEghWvfgc3me8wKYjGyMq_eREOW9QR4sF8/edit?usp=drive_link).
As well, I have included data from my own games that can be used as examples.

These scripts were created as an alternative to the resources found in the 
'chart' and 'deck_stats' sheets in the tracker, and provide a foundation for 
deeper dives and more intricate visualizations of the data. For most people, 
those resources will be sufficient enough for their needs. However, if you are 
familiar with R, these scripts offer a great starting point for deeper analyses 
or 'fancier' visualizations.
